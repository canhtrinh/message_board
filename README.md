To get this going, open two different terminals

From the root directory in one, run:
    - npm run build-and-run-server

From the root directory in the other, run:
    - npm run build-and-run-client

Some outstanding items:
    - started testing pattern but did not completely implement both ui and server level testing
    - did not package build (and so therefore I had you do the above to get the app to run)
